                <h2>About Me</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Hello.  My name is John Santoro and I will be graduating from the University of South Florida with a degree in computer science December 2017.  I was born on August 30, 1995, and I have lived in Clearwater, Florida my entire life.  During my teenage years, one of my main hobbies became computer programming, and the first language I learned was the Game Maker Language (GML).  I continued using this language until shortly before I graduated from Clearwater High School; at that time, I began learning how to use C# with Microsoft XNA Game Studio.  In addition to C#, while pursuing my bachelor's degree at the University of South Florida, I gained familiarity with the following languages:  C++, C, Java, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
            <img alt="This is a picture of myself." src="#" width="600">
            <p>The languages I know best are C# and C++.  During my time at USF, I used C# to design a few different windows applications, including a <a href="csharp_page.html">calculator app</a> using WPF.  I also used the Microsoft XNA Framework to create programs as a hobby.</p>
            <p>During my final two years at USF, I used C++ to design more advanced algorithms and data structures, including this specialized, fully functional <a href="cpp_page.html">3D graph</a>.  In addition to using C++ to implement Graphs, I also used it to create search trees, hash tables, and specialized lists; and to perform tasks pertaining to artificial intelligence and computational geometry.</p>
            <img alt="Some other relevant picture" src="#" width="600">
            <p>I am currently seeking entry-level employment opportunities in application/web development and software engineering.  If you are interested in interviewing me, please email me at [my email address].</p>
