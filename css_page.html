                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In the course of human history, one of the most controversial issues to date is the brainwashing of human beings.  Nation after nation has tried doing this, only to receive harsh criticism from their peers.  Since programming programmers is defined by the UN to be a form of brainwashing, one must consider how to do so effectively and ethically:  One would want them to program more quickly and accurately, but at the same time, avoid attracting attention from the authorities.</p>
                
                <h3>Programming Programmers Effectively</h3>
                <p>"There are too many calls to this recursive function," an unprogrammed programmer might say.  "I can only do an execution trace of the first 100 calls, and there are going to be more than 10,000."  In this particular case, there are a number of potential issues, including the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Poor Memory Allocation:</b> The memory blocks allocated to storing information about each iteration are too large.</li>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Background Processes:</b> The programmer is thinking about something else, which limits the ability to store information to a certain percentage of the brain.</li>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Low Processing Speed:</b> The programmer is able to store all of the information, but not in a timely manner.  As a result, the information that is stored is replaced by some other information about the environment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One solution is quite simple:  Connect programmers' brains to a computer via USB and then install Windows 10.  However, upon undertaking this task, one would find that all of the authorities would be investigating in under 24 hours.  Other solutions are described in the next section.</p>
                
                <h3>Programming Programmers Ethically</h3>
                <p>To avoid legal and civil consequences, one must carefully carefully consider the ethical impacts of one's efforts in programming programmers.  A few solutions not likely to raise suspicion include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Recitation:</b> Have programmers recite the following quote by a once-famous programmer:  
                    <p id="quote">"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Qui, nam. Consequuntur nisi temporibus eum, neque, eos dolorum, inventore et sequi impedit assumenda odit a accusamus delectus! Nostrum architecto repudiandae tempore maiores odio suscipit nemo, eos delectus, voluptatibus eum quam commodi atque voluptatem itaque laudantium!

                    500 times.  Doing so will program them to retain a larger amount of information, thus enabling them to perform larger mental execution traces.</li>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> Show programmers a portion of their genome, such as 'ATTACGATCGTATACGTATGTTTACGCCG,' and have them look for patterns.  This will program them to detect patterns, which will allow them to group repeated characteristics into one memory block, thus improving their ability to perform large mental execution traces.</li>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Dodgeball:</b> Playing Dodgeball programs programmers to store new information more quickly since they must keep track of where the dodgeballs are at all times.  By storing information more quickly, they will be less likely to replace it with useless information during large mental execution traces.</li>
                    <li class="dummy_page_list"><b>Meditation:</b> "Deleting all irrelevant information is what allows programmers to work most effectively," a famous scientist once said.  Thus, meditating programs programmers to better perform large mental execution traces by freeing memory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Therefore, one could say that programming programmers ethically is so easy, a caveman can do it.</p>
