            </header>
            <p>Hello.  My name is John Santoro and I will be graduating from the University of South Florida with a degree in computer science this December.  I was born on August 30, 1995, and I have lived in Clearwater, Florida my entire life.  During my teenage years, one of my main hobbies became computer programming, and the first language I learned was the Game Maker Language (GML).  I continued using this language until shortly before I graduated from Clearwater High School; at that time, I began learning how to use C# with Microsoft XNA Game Studio.  In addition to C#, while pursuing my bachelor's degree at the University of South Florida, I gained familiarity with the following languages:  C++, C, Java, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
